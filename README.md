  chmod +x user-coaching-installer.sh
  ```

2. Export the BIG-IP user:pass:
  ```bash
  export BIGUSER='admin:password'
  ```

3. Run the script to create all of the User Coaching objects
  ```bash
  ./user-coaching-installer.sh
  ```

4. Add the "user-coaching-ja4t-rule" iRule to the SSLO outbound topology interception rule
